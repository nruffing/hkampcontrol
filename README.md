# hkampcontrol
Application for controlling a Hughes &amp; Kettner GrandMeister Deluxe 40 via MIDI control and patch change events.

Although this application is being designed to control a specific amp that really only applies to what controls will be available and the application will support having multiple amp profiles to change which controller number will be used for each control change. Therefore it should be easy enough to adapt the application to other amps as well.
